# hyper-examples

Various experiments to help me learn hyper, particularly the new [hyper v1](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/hyper-v1/)

- [broadcast](./broadcast/src/main.rs): stream the current time to all connections using tokio::sync::broadcast
- [watch](./watch/src/main.rs): stream the current time to all connections using tokio::sync::watch
